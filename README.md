# Reddit Analysis

In this dataset there are a collection of posts from reddit.com from numerous programming-focused subreddits. Our task is to develop a model.

Within this directory there is a csv containing all posts made to a specific set of subreddits (message boards) during the month of December, along with some additional data (the number of upvotes from the community, the number of comments made on the post, etc.) The data has been subset to only self-posts (posts where the writer has submitted text instead of a link elsewhere).

## Objective

We will be using NLP (Natural Language Techniques) to categorigize Python related sub-reddit forums based on on the comments on posts themselves.

### We will be conducting the following with this analysis:
- EDA
- Data cleansing
- CountVectorizer Model
- Truncated SVD (Dimensionality Reduction)
- Classification Models
